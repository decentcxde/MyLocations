## Quick Review:

> With this app, users can save their favorite places. The app shows the user's location with an accuracy of 10 meters, which allows them to accurately save 
the location on the map. This app detects the user's location using the Core Location framework. Saved user locations are displayed on the map, using the Map Kit. 
Users can also attach photos to their saved locations using an iPhone camera or a photo library, all saved user data is stored using Core Data.
